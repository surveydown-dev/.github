surveydown is a platform for making flexible, open-source, interactive, and reproducible surveys with [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), and [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/).

This organization account contains the source code for the [{surveydown} R package](https://github.com/surveydown-dev/surveydown), the [surveydown.org website](https://surveydown.org/), and several demo surveys as examples. Each repo that starts with `demo-` contains the source code and files to run a specific demo / example survey (see the [demos page](https://surveydown.org/demos)).
